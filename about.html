								<h1>About me
								</h1>
								<h2>
									What is Prickly Pair Caravan?
								</h2>
                                <p>It is a way for you to try new board games at a low cost. I do weekly themed board game nights at Quarter Celtic. Tuesday nights we are at the Juan Tabo location and Wednesday nights at the San Mateo location. Both 6-8pm
								</p>
								
								<h2>
									Are the game nights really free?
								</h2>
                                <p>Yes! There is no cost to enter but any purchase you make at  Quarter Celtic is greatly appreciated! They have helped me so much to make this a reality so even a single beer purchase is a great way to support these nights. And no worries at all if you spill a drink or get food on a game. That's the cost of doing business babeyyy there is no charge for damaging a game. 
								</p>

								<h2>
									Where is the rest of your website?
								</h2>
                                <p>I am doing an overhaul on my inventory page and recommendations page. I have hidden them for now until i have time to finish that work. 
								</p>

								<h2>
									What inspired you to make the cart?
								</h2>
								<p>Imitation is the highest form of flattery. I saw a <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/boardgamepeddler/">post</a> of someone else who did something similar. They converted a pedal ice cream cart to sell board games out of. That combined with my love of board games gave me the motivation to make Prickly Pair Caravan a reality!</p>

								<h2>
									How did you get into board games?
								</h2>
								<p>A coworker invited me to their board game night in the winter of 2023. I had only ever played mainstream board games before and had no idea there was anything beyond that. From there the seed was planted and I hope Prickly Pair Caravan brings you some of that joy as well!</p>
							

								<h2>
									How do you get your prices so low?
								</h2>
								<p>A mixture of sales, discount codes, and meeting free shipping requirements allows me to sell games at or below $15. You can find similar prices online, maybe even a couple dollars less but shipping adds on 7 dollars minumum to your order.  </p>

								<h2>
									What are your margins?
								</h2>
								<p>I believe the most profit I make off a game is 20% with many games being around 5%-10% after accounting for tax. Combined with how much time I spend looking for games really makes this a labor of love. I'm not quitting my day job anytime soon ha. </p>

								<h2>
									How did you build the cart?
								</h2>
								<p>I purchased <a href = "https://www.etsy.com/listing/1217794383/candy-cart-trolley-style-plans-with">these</a> design plans for a cotton candy cart and then made modifications of my own. The biggest being wheelbarrow tires instead of bicycle due to the amount of goatheads here.</p>

								<h2>
									Plans for the future?
								</h2>
								<p>Currently we are only at Quarter Celtic. I would like to expand into artisan markets, I have something in the works for that! I can't sell my normal inventory but by mid October 2024 I hope to have a couple prototypes ready.</p>
