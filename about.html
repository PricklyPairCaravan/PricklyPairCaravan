				<p class="col-12 text-center">It is a way for you to try new board games for free and purchase games at a low cost. I started this because I did not know hobby board games existed until I was 26. And I want to share this with you. Because I wish I had found this out sooner!</p>

						<p class="text-center">Everything you need to know about me!</p>
						<div class="tm-accordion">
							<button class="accordion">Are the game nights really free?</button>
							<div class="panel">
							  <p>Yes! There is no cost to enter but any purchase you make at  Quarter Celtic is greatly appreciated! They have helped me so much to make this a reality so even a single beer purchase is a great way to support these nights. And no worries at all if you spill a drink or get food on a game. That's the cost of doing business babeyyy there is no charge for damaging a game.</p>
							</div>
							
							<button class="accordion">Why do you sell for $15 or less?</button>
							<div class="panel">
							  <p>Primarily because I can't afford to stock the newer and/or pricier games. And that's a fun pricepoint so even if you don't like the game hey, you only spent a little bit of cash.</p>
							</div>
							
							<button class="accordion">What inspired you to make the cart?</button>
							<div class="panel">
							  <p>Imitation is the highest form of flattery. I saw a <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/boardgamepeddler/">post</a> of someone else who did something similar. They converted a pedal ice cream cart to sell board games out of. That combined with my love of board games gave me the motivation to make Prickly Pair Caravan a reality!</p>
							</div>
							
							<button class="accordion">How did you get into board games?</button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>A coworker invited me to their board game night in the winter of 2023. I had only ever played mainstream board games before and had no idea there was anything beyond that. From there the seed was planted and I hope Prickly Pair Caravan brings you some of that joy as well!</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">How do you get your prices so low?</button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>A mixture of sales, discount codes, and meeting free shipping requirements allows me to sell games at or below $15. You can find similar prices online, maybe even a couple dollars less but shipping adds on anywhere between 5-10 dollars depending on the retailer to your order.</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">What are your margins?</button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>I believe the most profit I make off a game is 20% with many games being around 5%-10% after accounting for tax. Combined with how much time I spend looking for games really makes this a labor of love. I'm not quitting my day job anytime soon ha.</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">How did you build the cart?</button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>I purchased <a href = "https://www.etsy.com/listing/1217794383/candy-cart-trolley-style-plans-with">these</a> design plans for a cotton candy cart and then made modifications of my own. The biggest being wheelbarrow tires instead of bicycle due to the amount of goatheads here.</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">Plans for the future?</button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>Currently we are only at Quarter Celtic. I would like to expand into artisan markets, I have something in the works for that! I can't sell my normal inventory but by mid December 2024 I hope to have a couple prototypes ready.</p>
