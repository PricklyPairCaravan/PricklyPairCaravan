                                <p>A coworker invited me to their board game night in the winter of 2023. I had only ever played mainstream board games before and had no idea there was anything beyond that. From there the seed was planted and I hope Prickly Pair Caravan brings you some of that joy as well!</p>
                                <p><b>Are the game nights really free?</Pp></b>
                                <p>Yes! There is no cost to enter but any purchase you make at  Quarter Celtic is greatly appreciated! They have helped me so much to make this a reality so even a single beer purchase is a great way to support these nights. And no worries at all if you spill a drink or get food on a game. That's the cost of doing business babeyyy there is no charge for damaging a game.</p>
                                <p><b>Why do you sell for $15 or less?</p></b>
                                <p>Primarily because I can't afford to stock the newer and/or pricier games. And that's a fun pricepoint so even if you don't like the game hey, you only spent a little bit of cash.</p>
                                <p><b>How do you get your prices so low?</b></p>
                                <p>A mixture of sales, discount codes, and meeting free shipping requirements allows me to sell games at or below $15. You can find similar prices online, maybe even a couple dollars less but shipping adds on anywhere between 5-10 dollars depending on the retailer to your order.</p>
                                <p><b>What are your margins?</b></p>
                                <p>I believe the most profit I make off a game is 20% with many games being around 5%-10% after accounting for tax. Combined with how much time I spend looking for games really makes this a labor of love. I'm not quitting my day job anytime soon ha.</p>
                                <p><b>What inspired you to make the cart?</b></p>
                                <p>The cart has been retired and replaced with a boring folding table due to space issues and my back was tired of loading it into my van. But for the history of it all, imitation is the highest form of flattery. I saw a <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/boardgamepeddler/">post</a> of someone else who did something similar. They converted a pedal ice cream cart to sell board games out of.</p>
